GIT DEPLOY

This is a Capistrano recipe to perform a git-based deployment.

It (re)defines the following tasks:

deploy:setup
Set up the environment on the server for the subsequent deploy operations.
This task creates a "current" folder to put all the files in.

deploy:update_code
Pull from the appropriate git branch the most recent version.
This task also assigns a timestamped tag to the latest commit, to allow for
rollback operations. An example of tag: "deploy_20100422124950".

deploy:rollback
Roll back the deployed code to the latest available tag. This task restores
the latest deployment operation.
Subsequent runs of deploy:rollback go further back into the history.

deploy:migrate
Perform database migrations on the server.
